# Car_Price_Predictor
Machine Learning is the study of how machines can learn without being explicitly
programmed. To estimate and fit a linear relationship between a continuous response
variable and additional explanatory factors, multiple linear regression (MLR) models are
widely employed in various commercial domains linked to statistics and machine learning
(ML).
The primary objective of this project is to create a car price predictor model in
machine learning utilizing a linear regression model and the Random Forest Algorithm. To
learn the underlying relationship between these features and the car's value, the model will
be trained using a dataset of automotive features such as company name, model name, year
of purchase, number of kilometers traveled, and fuel type. The dataset will be cleaned and
transformed before being used to train the linear regression model. The finished model will
be implemented as a web application, allowing customers to enter the attributes of the car
and receive an estimated price based on the model's forecast. This concept has the potential
to assist both automobile buyers and sellers by providing a more accurate and objective
way to determine the value of a car based on its features.
The results of the project show that the linear regression model can predict the
price of a used car with a reasonable degree of accuracy of 0.91. The model also identifies
which features have the strongest influence on the price of a used car, and can be used to
test various scenarios, such as changing the mileage, year, or fuel type of the car.
